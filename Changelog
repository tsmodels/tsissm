# 2021-08-08 v0.1.8 [AG]
- Added option for rescaling the mean and variance of the simulated prediction
distribution by their exact moments (per the Hyndman paper). Will no also return
the analytic_mean in the prediction object.

# 2021-06-20 v0.1.7 [AG]
- Added handling of missing values using the prediction filter step and calculation of the
likelihood only for non missing values.
- Added autodiff option (calls tsissmad package)
- Prettified the returned summary to display abbreviated model description and use
kable (similar to how tsets displays the summary).

# 2021-04-19 v0.1.6 [AG]
- Exported tsmetric method on predict object and fixed an issue with calculating
MASE (by passing lowest frequency to object).

# 2020-09-16 v0.1.5 [AG]
- Added parameter transformation function for unconstrained optimizers (optim/Nelder-Mead)
- Fixed specification for cases without seasonality or regular seasonality (bug in the ss_matrices.R file)
- Added some checks to tsbacktest to not fail completely if an estimation had problems, instead returning
NA's for the predictions of that run and calculating metrics on only good data (non NA)
