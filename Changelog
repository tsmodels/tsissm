# 2020-09-16 v0.1.5 [AG]
- Added parameter transformation function for unconstrained optimizers (optim/Nelder-Mead)
- Fixed specification for cases without seasonality or regular seasonality (bug in the ss_matrices.R file)
- Added some checks to tsbacktest to not fail completely if an estimation had problems, instead returning
NA's for the predictions of that run and calculating metrics on only good data (non NA)
